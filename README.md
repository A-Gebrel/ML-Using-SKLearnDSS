SKLearn is a known library to implement and test Machine Learning modules in Python.
The purpose of this repo is to play around with those for my own fun

### Modules included
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighour (kNN)
  - Decision Tree

### Project includes

  - The .py I wrote for each module (hopefully not too bad)
  - The .txt file which shows the output of each script.

### Requirement
This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* SKlearn
* matplotlib (unused)


### Last word
- Hope I won't disappoint you too much with my bad coding.
- Always accepting constructive criticism.
